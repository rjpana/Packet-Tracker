# Packet-Tracker
This project captures network packets from your computer and maps them for clear visual representation.


# How It Works
1. Capture packets using **Wireshark**.  
2. Export the capture as a **CSV file**.  
3. Run this tool to generate a `.kml` file.  
4. Open the `.kml` in **Google Maps My Maps** or **Google Earth** to visualize your traffic.
